# SummerWinterRecognition
A Tensorflow model using a CNN for recognising if an image was taken during the summer or the winter. 
Around 7000 images of social situations were collected and used during training. These images were scraped from a website using a python library that could take over the controls of the keyboard and mouse.

Various techinques were used to improve learning such as scaling, random zoom, random rotations and dataset balancing. 

The final model had an accuracy of 0.68 for the test set. I am currently working on a website where you can input your own images and see what the model thinks!

The training images and data collection were not included to preserve privacy.
