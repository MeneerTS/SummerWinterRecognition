# SummerWinterRecognition
A Tensorflow model for recognising if an image was taken during the summer or the winter. 
Around 7000 images of social situations were collected and used during training. These images were scraped from a website using a python library that could take over the controls of the keyboard and mouse.


The training images and data collection were not included to preserve privacy.
